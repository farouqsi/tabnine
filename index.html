Hey Lexi, How is the progress on the audio?
lexi — 02/01/2024 11:46 AM
I’ve got it to where the audio will play on the transcript page. Working on getting is synchronized with the transcript
Just getting it to play was harder than I thought lol
Nomaddevs — 02/01/2024 12:10 PM
Nice, that's the hard part you got done already I would say we should try to merge that in first and try to fix merge conflict. Then you can then create a new branch for the interative
lexi — 02/01/2024 12:38 PM
Ok that’s fine. I’m about to go to practice and won’t be available until like 8 tonight
lexi — 02/02/2024 10:35 AM
created pull request to merge those branches. there are no conflicts
Nomaddevs — 02/02/2024 6:37 PM
Hey got it will merge
lexi — 02/04/2024 11:33 AM
hey i saw the comments on the merge request. I can totally do all of that i just forgot to delete all the commented stuff lol. I only have a little bit of time to work on it rn but if i don't get stuff updated i for sure will tonight
Nomaddevs — 02/04/2024 11:43 AM
Yh for sure no rush.
lexi — 02/04/2024 11:45 AM
for the AudioProvider I can add it to the index.tsx but I can't remove it from App.tsx because then the transcript doesn't have access to the AudioContext
Nomaddevs — 02/04/2024 11:52 AM
Since it is a context you will be able to access it in the transcript if it is available in the index.tx
lexi — 02/04/2024 5:53 PM
okay i made all the changes
I can work this week on getting the UI to look like the figma design, but my main concern was getting the audio to play, so no that that's done ill make it look all pretty lol and get it synchronized.
Nomaddevs — 02/04/2024 6:17 PM
Yh since it works getting it to look like the figma will be easier. Will merge it when I get home
Nomaddevs — 02/04/2024 11:54 PM
we have merge conflict
lexi — 02/05/2024 6:58 AM
ugh that's annoying. there wasn't one when i went to bed last night
lexi — 02/06/2024 7:23 AM

Nomaddevs — 02/06/2024 7:24 AM

lexi — 02/06/2024 7:25 AM

Nomaddevs — 02/06/2024 7:25 AM
